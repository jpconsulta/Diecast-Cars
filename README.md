Lis 161: Diecast Cars – Title of our Website
Diecast cars – toycars sold in different manufacturing companies.
SQL - In each Diecast cars, our group decided to put different categories in SQL, mainly id, manufacturer (where these are sold), the carbrands, carnames, series, release year, color, material, price, and URL. These are seen in mostly our index.html and when you press the kinds of carbrands such as Hotwheels, it should show the description of hot wheels whih include mainly id, manufacturer (where these are sold), the carbrands, carnames, series, release year, color, material, price, and URL.  Aside from this, our searchpage , we decided to write in the categories. Usually if not found, then the data would then immediately request a “not found” in the search bar.
In addition, we did a labeling of our newlisting for each diecast category from manufactuer, carbrands, carnames, series, release year, color, material, price, and URL We wanted to make sure that each file is uniformed and therefore, each of us did our own documentation process, with Angel’s file being the main one. Aside from this, when he had sent it to the Github, we first had to fix the navbar, html of the templates such as carbrand and put the data of SQL there. This became our way to make sure that when the testing happens, the data would still be there. Angel tried the testing on his computer and the parts of carbrand, kami.html worked.
